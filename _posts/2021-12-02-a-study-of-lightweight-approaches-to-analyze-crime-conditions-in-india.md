This research paper explores crime trends in India from 2001 to 2019, utilizing a top-to-bottom analytical approach. Key methods include heat map visualizations that pinpoint crime types across all states of India. It also incorporates an examination of various demographic factors, such as age groups, gender, and caste, to provide a comprehensive understanding of crime patterns.

Proactive measures based on these analyses are proposed to mitigate crime rates and criminal activities effectively.
