* Dirio is a UK-based startup that is in its initial phase but led by a team of well-experienced people of at least 20+ years of experience each.
* My responsibilities were as a FullStack developer-oriented towards the front end and user interface technologies, with server-side work as well
* Technologies I used in the process was React.js with TypeScript on the front-end and some work in Python on the back-end, on a Linux environment.
