Ad-Tech and Search

* I am dedicated to the Ads team. My focus lies in crafting tech-driven solutions that fuel restaurant‚Äôs growth.
* I currently own the Ads Serving Service, which runs on 350k RPM at peak and is load tested at 1.5M RPM.
* I have worked on optimisations to reduce gRPC latency and have worked on the system resiliency from transactional to feedback systems built on Apache Flink through and through.
* For Ads business I have worked on multiple target pacing and Ads ranking logic to increase Ads revenue and platform relevancy
