# About Me

I'm currently a Software Development Engineer 2 at Zomato in the Ads Team. I own the Ads Serving Service, adept at managing peak loads of up to 350k RPM and successfully conducting load tests at 1.5M RPM. My role involves driving technical innovations that directly contribute to substantial revenue growth and platform relevance for our Ads business.

At [Zomato](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zomato){:target="_blank"}, I've led major initiatives to reduce gRPC latency and strengthen system resilience, utilizing cutting-edge technologies like Apache Flink. My technical skills are diverse, ranging across Golang, JavaScript, PHP, and Python. Prior to my current role, I was integral in migrating the Ads Creation System from a PHP-based monolith to a robust Golang Microservices architecture, while also developing the Ads platform using React.js. This showcases my versatility in handling both frontend and backend development.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I am passionate about open-source projects and have led projects like a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Stack_Overflow_icon.svg" width="20" height="20"> StackOverflow Clone](https://github.com/Mayank0255/Stackoverflow-Clone-Frontend){:target="_blank"}</span> and [ðŸ‘¾ Amegma Galaxy Attack](https://github.com/Amegma/Galaxy-Attack){:target="_blank"}, both of which have garnered significant attention and community engagement on GitHub.

I am keen to connect with fellow technology enthusiasts and explore potential collaborations or opportunities.
